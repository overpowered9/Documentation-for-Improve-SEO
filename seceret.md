**Report Date:** October 26, 2023
**Investigation Subject:** Analysis of the operational and structural links between Rinxo (trading platform) and Rissox (software company).

---

## Executive Summary
This report consolidates evidence proving that Rinxo Ltd. (the trading platform) and the Rissox entities in Pakistan and the UAE are sister companies operating under a unified multi-entity, multi-jurisdictional structure. Internal corporate documents explicitly define Rissox as the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) provider responsible for all technology, HR, finance, and back-office operations for Rinxo.

## 1. Direct Evidence: Internal Corporate Documents
This is the most definitive proof of the relationship, sourced from the companies' own internal policy handbooks.

### 1.1 HR Policy Handbook
**Key Evidence:** The document states it is designed for "the multi-entity, multi-jurisdictional structure of **Rinxo Ltd., Rissox Pakistan, and Rissox UAE**" and defines the role of each entity.[^1]

**Defined Roles:**
*   **Rinxo Ltd.**: "A globally distributed trading organization focusing on compliance, risk management, and liquidity provider management."
*   **Rissox Pakistan**: "A business process outsourcing (BPO) provider primarily responsible for **technological development, HR support, finance, customer service, and back-office operations for Rinxo Ltd. and Rissox UAE.**"
*   **Rissox UAE**: "A BPO provider in the UAE focusing on sales, marketing, funds management, and business development for Rinxo Ltd."

**Implication:** This conclusively proves a formal, integrated corporate structure where the Rissox companies are established specifically to support Rinxo's core trading operations.

### 1.2 Remote Work and Attendance Policy
**Key Evidence:** The policy outlines the framework for remote work "across **Rinxo Ltd., Rissox Pakistan, and Rissox UAE**."[^2]

**Implication:** This further corroborates integrated management and operational policies across the entities, supporting the claim of a unified organization.

## 2. Corroborating Evidence: Professional Network Links
Profiles on LinkedIn show shared human resources and management, indicating the entities are under common control and share staff.

| Name | Role(s) | Evidence of Link | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sarmad Amin** | Recruiter at Rinxo; Human Resource Officer at Rissox. | Direct, **concurrent employment** at both Rinxo and Rissox (March 2025 - Present). | [^3] |
| **Tasmeer Mujeeb** | Hiring Consultant at Rinxo; Former Senior Manager, Human Resources at Rissox. | Career transition **from Rissox to Rinxo**, showing internal staff flow. | [^4] |
| **Bushra Shahbaz** | Recruiter at Rinxo; Technical Recruiter at Rissox. | Direct, **concurrent employment** at both companies (February 2025 - Present). | [^5] |

## 3. Corporate Structure & Jurisdictional Findings
The investigation reveals a complex corporate history involving multiple jurisdictions, adding a layer to the business structure.

| Entity Name | Jurisdiction | Status | Key Dates & Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RINXO LTD** | United Kingdom (Companies House) | **Dissolved** | **Incorporated:** 7 Feb 2024<br>**Dissolved:** 15 Jul 2025<br>**Nature of Business:** Administration of financial markets, Security and commodity contracts dealing.[^6] |
| **Rinxo LTD** | Saint Lucia (IBC Registry) | **Presumably Active** | **Registration No:** 2023-00658<br>Presented as the operating company on `rinxo.com` and in external broker reviews.[^7] |
| **Rissox** | Pakistan & UAE | **Active** | Acts as the technology and BPO provider as defined in the internal HR policies.[^1] |
| **Rinxo Trading Platform** | Global (Online) | **Operational** | Actively markets trading services in forex, stocks, commodities, and crypto via `rinxo.com`.[^7] |

**Analysis:** The dissolution of the short-lived UK entity (`RINXO LTD`) suggests ongoing corporate restructuring. The Saint Lucia entity (`Rinxo LTD`) appears to be the current primary corporate vehicle for the customer-facing trading platform, which is a common offshore structure for online brokers. This multi-jurisdictional setup aligns with the "multi-entity, multi-jurisdictional" description in the HR handbook.[^1]

## 4. Public-Facing Profiles & Service Alignment

| Company | Domain | Public Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rinxo** | `rinxo.com` | Presents as a "multi-asset STP broker" and "global trading platform." The site lists **Rinxo LTD** (Saint Lucia, No. 2023-00658) as its registered entity.[^7] |
| **Rissox** | `rissox.com` | Describes itself as a "cutting-edge software development company" specializing in **fintech solutions, custom CRM, and web/mobile app development**.[^8] |

**Logical Connection:** Rissox's stated core service (building fintech software) is the exact foundational requirement for Rinxo's core product (a fintech trading platform). This perfectly aligns with Rissox's defined role as the technology provider for Rinxo in the internal HR policies.[^1]

## 5. Integrated Analysis & Conclusion
The preponderance of evidence from multiple independent sources confirms the corporate relationship:

1.  **Definitive Proof:** Internal HR policies explicitly list Rinxo Ltd., Rissox Pakistan, and Rissox UAE as parts of a single multi-entity structure, with Rissox's purpose defined as supporting Rinxo.[^1]
2.  **Operational Proof:** Shared staff and management, as seen on professional networks, demonstrate integrated human resources and common control.[^3][^4][^5]
3.  **Strategic Proof:** The complementary nature of their public services (fintech software development and running a trading platform) logically fits the described internal relationship.[^7][^8]
4.  **Structural Proof:** The existence and dissolution of Rinxo entities in different jurisdictions (UK, Saint Lucia) illustrate the complex, multi-jurisdictional approach referenced in their internal documents.[^1][^6]

**Conclusion:** Rinxo and Rissox are fundamentally connected as part of a single corporate group. The relationship is not a typical client-vendor partnership but a **structured, hierarchical arrangement** where Rissox Pakistan and Rissox UAE are established BPO providers responsible for the essential technological, operational, and administrative functions of the Rinxo Ltd. trading platform.
